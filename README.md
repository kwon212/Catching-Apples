Fundamentals of Computing Final Project

This is a fun and simple Fruit Catching game using C! 

Try catching the apples and power ups to get the highest point possible. But, be careful and make sure to avoid the falling bombs. The friut, bomb, and power ups will all move at different speeds. The game will end after 100 apples fall. The position of the basket is moved using the keyboard. It uses the gfx library to provide the user with a easy-to-use interface, so make sure to use the gfx 3 files when running the game. 

The program utilizes linked lists to create the apples, bombs, and bonus powerups. There are 4 apples displayed on the screen at all times, and once they hit the bottom of the screen, they are "recycled" into the system. Similarly, the bombs and power ups are also recycled when they hit the bottom of the page. For a preview of this game, see image file Falling Fruit_Preview.
