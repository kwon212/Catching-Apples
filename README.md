This is a fun and simple Fruit Catching game using C! 

Try catching the fruits and power ups to get the highest point possible. But, be careful and make sure to avoid the falling bombs. The game will end after 100 apples fall. It uses the gfx library to provide the user with a easy-to-use interface. The position of the basket is moved using the keyboard. The program utilizes linked lists to create the apples, bombs, and bonus powerups. There are 4 apples displayed on the screen at all times, and once they hit the bottom of the screen, they are "recycled" into the system by the resetapple function, which manipulates the x position and the velocity. Similarly, the bombs and power ups are also recycled when they hit the bottom of the page.
